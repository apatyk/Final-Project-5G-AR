### Motivation
AR and VR demand high bandwidth and low latency to provide an immersive and seamless experience. Current networks do not meet the streaming requirements needed to provide this experience. However, emerging 5G technologies provide higher data rates, lower latency, and increased capacity than existing networks. Therefore 5G, and specifically high-band 5G, has the ability to stream AR and VR experiences in real time. One downside to high-band 5G that fulfills these needs is that it only works well over short distances. Due to this limitation, an efficient handoff/switching system is crucial in providing a seamless experience.

### Project Description
In this project, we investigate mobile-controlled handoff (MCHO) associated with high-band 5G cellular networks with a focus on an AR headset. In this situation, the AR device will determine which tower provides the best signal. This device will then control handoff between towers to maintain the best connection and cohesive AR experience.
